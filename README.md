**IMPORTANT NOTE: We used the "_25.stl " files in the international competition**

ðŸ”¹ Introduction

This repository contains 3D models and STL files used for 3D printing parts of our WRO Future Engineers robot.
The files include chassis, motor mounts, sensor holders, and other custom components designed for precision, durability, and compactness.

ðŸ”¹ Features

3D models designed specifically for our robot layout.

Compatible with standard 3D printers (FDM/FFF).

Includes mounts for Raspberry Pi 4, sensors, motors, and H-Bridge.

Easy to modify in CAD software if adjustments are needed.

ðŸ”¹ Usage in WRO Robot

Chassis: Holds motors, wheels, and electronics in proper positions.

Sensor Holders: Keeps ultrasonic and color sensors stable.

Motor Mounts: Ensures precise alignment with wheels.

Cable Management: Clips and guides to organize wiring.


ðŸ”¹ Notes

Print orientation, layer height, and infill may affect strength and fit.

Some parts may require support structures during printing.

Check tolerances before assembling parts on the robot.

ðŸ”¹ Future Work

Optimize models for lighter weight.

Add modular sensor holders for easier replacement.

Create versioned improvements after testing in WRO.
